- Share individual texts with others
- Hackable/Customizable

- For command-line tool use `textify --help` for detailed usage.

- For Android/iOS/MacOS/Windows see [this](https://github.com).

## Requirements

	Download APK (Upload to F-droid pending)
- Linux:
    - Python 3
- Windows/MacOS/iOS
   Cross-Platform desktop app not compiled for Windows/MacOS
